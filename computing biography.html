        <h2>Past Experience</h2>
        <p class="aligncenter">
          I did not have another other web programming experience before coming
          into this class. However, I did have computer programming experience
          before coming into this class so I think that has helped me along the
          way in learning web programming.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p class="aligncenter">
          My main motivation for taking this class was because I am forced too
          for my major, since I am a computer science major. However, I am not
          sure what I want to do carrer wise with my major yet and I am enjoying
          this class so far so I might have just taken this class for fun if it
          was not required for my major.
